    "# Checking if a string could be a palindrome\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably been tasked at some point or another to write a program that checks whether or not a given string is a palindrome. If not, try it! It's a good exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is not to check for palindromes, but to check whether or not a string, if it were arranged in a certain way, could be a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But what is a palindrome?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not already familiar with the term, a palindrome is a string of characters, alphabetical or numerical, that are symmetric arround their middle. A phrase like \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\" is a palindrome, or even a date such as 21/9/21. Try reading them backwards and you'll find that they read the same (whitespace characters not considered).\n",
    "\n",
    "**So how do we check if a string could be a palindrome?** It's simple. First, let's get user's input:"
